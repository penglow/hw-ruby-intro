# Docker image for CHIP 2.5 (Ruby Intro).
#
# Builds an environment with the Ruby version and gems the assignment needs,
# and defaults to the interactive RSpec runner menu. GitHub Codespaces and the
# VS Code Dev Containers extension build this same file, via
# .devcontainer/devcontainer.json -- there is no separate dev image.
#
# It lives here in solutions/ because that is what build_starter_code.json
# copies to the root of the generated starter repo, which is the build context
# the COPY paths below are relative to. build_codio.json excepts it, so it does
# not reach the Codio workspace.
#
# Adapted from the NYU CSE Software Engineering version of this assignment:
# https://github.com/NYU-CSE-Software-Engineering/hw-ruby-intro
# The assignment needs Ruby >= 3.3.8 (see Gemfile); track the latest 3.3.x
# patch release rather than freezing on one.
